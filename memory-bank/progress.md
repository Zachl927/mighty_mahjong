# Mighty Mahjong Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Sichuan Mahjong implementation according to the phases and steps outlined in the implementation plan.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Architecture
- [x] Step 1: Project Initialization
  - Created project structure with required directories (assets, scenes, scripts, resources, tests)
  - Set up project configuration with 1280x720 window size
  - Created basic main scene and test scene
  - Implemented test validation script
  - Created placeholder icon
  - *Completed on: March 14, 2025*
- [x] Step 2: Create Core Game State Manager
  - Implemented game_state_manager.gd with state machine functionality
  - Added game state transition methods and signals
  - Added game data management (players, rounds, etc.)
  - Created validation test scene to demonstrate state transitions
  - *Completed on: March 14, 2025*
- [x] Step 3: Design Basic UI Framework
  - Implemented main scene (main.tscn) with modular UI containers
  - Created MainMenu, GameArea, PlayerHands, DiscardPile, ActionButtons, and ChatArea components
  - Developed main_ui_controller.gd to handle UI navigation and game state interaction
  - Created test_ui_framework.tscn validation scene to test UI layout and navigation
  - *Completed on: March 14, 2025*

## Phase 2: Game Logic Implementation
- [x] Step 4: Create Tile System
  - **Preparation**: Added mahjong-tileset assets folder with tile images in multiple resolutions (64px, 96px, 128px, 618px)
  - Implemented `tile.gd` class defining tile properties, types, and comparison methods
  - Created `tile_asset_manager.gd` to handle mapping and loading of tile textures
  - Developed `tile_manager.gd` for managing tile creation, shuffling, and distribution
  - Created `tile.tscn` scene for displaying and interacting with tiles
  - Implemented `tile_display.gd` for tile selection/highlighting behaviors
  - Added test scene for validating tile system implementation
  - *Completed on: March 14, 2025*

- [x] Step 5: Implement Player Hand Management 
  - Created `player_hand.gd` script to manage the player's hand, including:
	- Methods for adding, removing, and sorting tiles
	- Functions to identify potential sets (Pongs, Kongs, Chows)
	- Logic for forming sets with discarded tiles
	- Tracking exposed sets and checking for winning conditions
  - Developed `player_hand.tscn` scene for visual representation
  - Implemented `player_hand_display.gd` for UI interaction
  - Created and tested with `test_player_hand.tscn` scene
  - Fixed syntax errors in implementation files
  - Enhanced player hand display with multi-tile selection functionality
  - *Completed on: March 14, 2025*

- [x] Step 6: Implement Game Rules
  - Created `game_rules.gd` script to implement Sichuan Mahjong rules, including:
    - Action validation (draw, discard, claim, win)
    - Suit restriction validation (max 2 suits per hand)
    - Winning pattern validation
  - Implemented test files for game rules validation
  - Fixed suit restriction validation logic to correctly check suit_type instead of tile type
  - Fixed action validation method signatures to ensure consistent parameter naming
  - Created comprehensive test cases to verify rule implementation
  - *Partially completed on: March 14, 2025*

## Phase 3: Networking Implementation
- [ ] Step 7: Set Up Basic Networking
- [ ] Step 8: Implement Game State Synchronization
- [ ] Step 9: Implement Player Turns and Actions

## Phase 4: UI and Interaction
- [ ] Step 10: Implement Tile Drawing and Discarding
- [ ] Step 11: Implement Tile Claiming
- [ ] Step 12: Implement Basic Scoring

## Phase 5: Data Persistence
- [ ] Step 13: Set Up SQLite Database
- [ ] Step 14: Implement Currency System

## Phase 6: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Step 15: Integrate All Components
- [ ] Step 16: Implement Comprehensive Error Handling
- [ ] Step 17: Optimize Performance
- [ ] Step 18: Final Testing and Debugging

## Notes
- Implementation started: March 13, 2025
- Development approach: Single developer, no strict timeline
- All features are considered must-have for the complete implementation
